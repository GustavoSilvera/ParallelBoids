\section*{Current Progress:} 
\par After further investigation of our original proposal \textit{(parallel phase-based video interpolation)} we have decided that it would be more beneficial to focus on a project that has a lower barrier-of-entry so we could start on implementation early. 

\section*{Goals & Deliverables:} 
We plan to implement 2 parallel implementations of the Boid algorithm, one utilizing the GPU via CUDA and the other utilizing multicore processing via 
\textbf{Parallelization Schemes:}\\
- OMP + MPI (threads go brr on multiple pc's)\\
- CUDA + SIMD (vectorize the boids themselves)\\
- Experiment with 

\textbf{Nice to have:}\\
- Compute frames at double the time granularity and interpolate the middle frames 
  by averaging boid positions. Compare the time it takes to do this and measure the 
  accuracy of the approximated frames.
